    "A few things right from the start. I am uncomfortable with the idea of classifying someone as 'likely to repay' or 'not likely to repay' based on what type of items that person is buying. Spending more on dining out instead of groceries suggests one does not wish to cook for themselves, not that they won't repay bills.  A better predictor of payment, or non-payment, would be the customers own payment history. That being said, a new customer does not have any payment history and therefor some other way of predicting is required.\n",

I specifically left out DiningOut vs Groceries, expecting those two variables to be inversely related to each other. I also did not want to have a tie. With these three scores, we can then classify if a new customer is likely to repay or not repay. "
